## Creating our first table
    
Under the hood, Supabase's database is just [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), an excellent open source database.
Lets get our first table set up, using one of the presets they provide.

1. First, open the project, and find the `SQL Editor` (an icon on the left sidebar)
2. Under `Getting Started / Welcome`, there is a section `Quick Start`, find the `User Management Starter`
3. Open the `User Management Starter`, and click `Run`.
4. Confirm that it worked correctly by opening the `Table Editor` (another icon on the sidebar), and making sure that a `profiles` table exists.
