## Testing it all together
Now we can run our project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see something similar to this, which includes the URL for our local app.
```txt
VITE v3.0.0  ready in 220 ms

➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/ <-- This is the link to our local app
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

If you see `200`, then you have configured Supabase correctly; otherwise, double check that you have followed the steps correctly.
