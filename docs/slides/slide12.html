## Adding our Stock Photo

### Goals
- Place the stock photo into our card
- We also need to make sure that we aren't stretching the photo, while still constraining it to the space we want it in.

### Hints
- The image is `w-80` wide
- We need to wrap our `img` element in another element for this effect to work.

### End Result
<img src="/images/image%20added.png" width="600px"/>
