## Adding Supabase to our project

Open your project in Supabase, and fill in the appropriate fields in the `.env` file. 

_Remove the `SUPABASE_PRIVATE_KEY` and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` lines, we won't need them for this project, and they can pose a security risk._

You should end up with something like this:

```bash
# .env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=[[ Project Configuration -> URL ]]
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[[ Project Api Keys -> anon public ]]
```

#### Adding Supabase to our project

Next, lets make a couple tweaks to the generated `src/lib/db.js`, these are optional, and mostly stylistic, but it will keep things consistent as we continue on.

1. Rename `db.js` to `db.ts`
2. Delete line 8:

	```typescript
	export default supabase
    ```

3. Change line 3:

    ```typescript
	// Add export

    export const supabase = createClient(
	```
