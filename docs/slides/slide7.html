## Installing Tailwind

Setting up tailwind should be very straightforward,
First, run the setup script
```bash
npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss
```

To confirm that it's working, go to `src/routes/index.svelte` again, and we'll replace it with:  

```html
<div class="w-64 h-64 bg-blue-200"></div>
```  

Run the app, and if you see a blue square on the screen, then tailwind has been set up!
