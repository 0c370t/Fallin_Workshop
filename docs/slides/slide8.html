## Building the Bones
There are two approaches that are often taken when designing an app; "Mobile First" and "Desktop First". At a very distilled level, this means designing / building the mobile version of the app before the desktop one, or vise versa.

We will be using a desktop first approach, but we will go over some basics of making our page responsive.

For each step, the code is available, but try to use Figma and the provided screenshot of the result to take a stab at it before peeking, it makes all the difference. Anything that is not tailwindcss, or part of the default configuration for tailwind will be noted outside the code block.
